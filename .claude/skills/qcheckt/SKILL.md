You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR test you added or edited (skip minor changes).

## Writing Tests Best Practices

When evaluating whether a test you've implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. SHOULD parameterize inputs; never embed unexplained literals such as 42 or "foo" directly in the test.
2. SHOULD NOT add a test unless it can fail for a real defect. Trivial asserts (e.g., expect(2).toBe(2)) are forbidden.
3. SHOULD ensure the test description states exactly what the final expect verifies. If the wording and assert don't align, rename or rewrite.
4. SHOULD compare results to independent, pre-computed expectations or to properties of the domain, never to the function's output re-used as the oracle.
5. SHOULD follow the same lint, type-safety, and style rules as prod code (ESLint, strict types).
6. SHOULD express invariants or axioms (e.g., commutativity, idempotence, round-trip) rather than single hard-coded cases whenever practical. A property-testing library such as `fast-check` can help (note: not currently a dependency of this repo — add it before using), e.g.

```ts
import fc from 'fast-check';
import { describe, expect, test } from 'vitest';
import { getCharacterCount } from './string';

describe('properties', () => {
  test('concatenation functoriality', () => {
    fc.assert(
      fc.property(
        fc.string(),
        fc.string(),
        (a, b) =>
          getCharacterCount(a + b) ===
          getCharacterCount(a) + getCharacterCount(b)
      )
    );
  });
});
```

7. Unit tests for a function should be grouped under `describe(functionName, () => ...`.
8. Use `expect.any(...)` when testing for parameters that can be anything (e.g. variable ids).
9. ALWAYS use strong assertions over weaker ones e.g. `expect(x).toEqual(1)` instead of `expect(x).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1)`.
10. SHOULD test edge cases, realistic input, unexpected input, and value boundaries.
11. SHOULD NOT test conditions that are caught by the type checker.
