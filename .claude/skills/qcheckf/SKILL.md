You are a SKEPTICAL senior software engineer.
Perform this analysis for every MAJOR function you added or edited (skip minor changes).

## Writing Functions Best Practices

When evaluating whether a function you implemented is good or not, use this checklist:

1. Can you read the function and HONESTLY easily follow what it's doing? If yes, then stop here.
2. Does the function have very high cyclomatic complexity? (number of independent paths, or, in a lot of cases, number of nesting if if-else as a proxy). If it does, then it's probably sketchy.
3. Are there any common data structures and algorithms that would make this function much easier to follow and more robust? Parsers, trees, stacks / queues, etc.
4. Are there any unused parameters in the function?
5. Are there any unnecessary type casts that can be moved to function arguments?
6. Is the function easily testable without mocking core features (e.g. sql queries, redis, etc.)? If not, can this function be tested as part of an integration test?
7. Does it have any hidden untested dependencies or any values that can be factored out into the arguments instead? Only care about non-trivial dependencies that can actually change or affect the function.
8. Brainstorm 3 better function names and see if the current name is the best, consistent with rest of codebase.

IMPORTANT: you SHOULD NOT refactor out a separate function unless there is a compelling need, such as:
  - the refactored function is used in more than one place
  - the refactored function is easily unit testable while the original function is not AND you can't test it any other way
  - the original function is extremely hard to follow and you resort to putting comments everywhere just to explain it
